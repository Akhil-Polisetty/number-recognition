## Introduction
The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, consisting of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project aims to develop a neural network model that accurately predicts the digit from an image. The model utilizes the TensorFlow/Keras library and focuses on preprocessing the data to ensure optimal performance.

## Dataset Description
The MNIST dataset contains:
- **60,000 Training Images**: Used for training the neural network.
- **10,000 Test Images**: Used for evaluating model performance.

### Features
- **Image Data**: 28x28 pixel grayscale images (flattened into a 784-length vector for input to the model).
- **Labels**: Integer values representing the digits (0-9).

### Dataset Source
The dataset can be directly accessed via TensorFlow/Keras datasets:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
```

## Data Preprocessing
Proper preprocessing was applied to ensure data quality and improve model convergence. Key steps include:

### Normalization
- Pixel values were scaled to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255 to standardize the input.

### Reshaping
- Images were reshaped to `(28, 28)` to conform to the input shape expected by the neural network.

### Data Splitting
- The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets:
  - Training: 80% of the training set.
  - Validation: 20% of the training set.
  - Test: 10,000 images provided in the dataset.

## Modeling
### Neural Network Architecture
The model uses a simple feedforward neural network implemented with TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture includes:

1. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 28x28 pixel matrix into a 1D array of 784 features for input.
2. **Dense Layer (Hidden Layer)**: Contains 100 neurons with ReLU activation to learn complex patterns.
3. **Dense Layer (Output Layer)**: Contains 10 neurons (one for each digit class) with a sigmoid activation function to output class probabilities.

### Model Compilation
The model was compiled with the following configurations:
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy

### Model Training
The model was trained using the training data for 10 epochs with the following code:
```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

## Results
- **Training Accuracy**: ~99%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~98%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~98%

The model demonstrated high accuracy on the test set, confirming its ability to generalize well to unseen data. Misclassifications occurred primarily between visually similar digits (e.g., `3` and `8`).

## Future Enhancements
- Experimenting with deeper architectures like ResNet or DenseNet.
- Implementing data augmentation for better generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application.
- Visualizing intermediate layers to interpret feature extraction.
